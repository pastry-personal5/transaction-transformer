### Reverse Stock Split

A reverse stock split is a type of corporate action that consolidates the number of existing shares of stock into fewer (higher-priced) shares. A reverse stock split divides the existing total quantity of shares by a number such as five or 10, which would then be called a 1-for-5 or 1-for-10 reverse split, respectively. A reverse stock split also is known as a stock consolidation, stock merge, or share rollback and is the opposite of a stock split, where a share is divided (split) into multiple parts.

### Stock Split

A stock split happens when a company increases the number of its shares to boost the stock's liquidity.
